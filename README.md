- **User Registration and Management**: Users can easily register, manage their profiles, and join or create Equb groups.
- **Contribution Tracking**: Participants can track their contributions and view group savings in real time.
- **Winner Selection**: The platform allows for random selection of beneficiaries, ensuring fair distribution of pooled funds.
- **Secure Transactions**: The application incorporates security measures to protect user data and financial transactions.

The goal of ACT Digital Equb is to promote financial inclusion and community collaboration, making saving and investing more accessible and efficient for users.
